# appendix/godot_scripts

This folder contains original (old) scripts when I was using for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) projects.

This is a similar concept to [large-file-checker](../../scripts/large-file-checker) script, but easpecially for Godot Engine projects. (Utilizing `*.import` files. If not `*.import` exists, you can define `list.txt` in any folder you want. But you should modify `list.txt` by hands, in this old version.)
